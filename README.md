# Image Processing / Grundlagen Bildverarbeitung (PS)


This repository contains solutions to the assignments of the course "Image Processing & Computer Vision" conducted by Prof. Dr. Kwitt at the University of Salzburg, Department of Computer Science.

The course is part of the Master degree programs "Computer Science" and "Applied Image and Signal Processing". The Image Processing & Computer Vision course was conducted in WS 2017.


## Assignments

### Assignment 1

##### Exercise 1.1
Write a Python function avg_H_global which takes as input the filename of an RGB image and computes the average value of the H channel. This value should be returned

##### Exercise 1.2

### Recommendation

I do recommend to use Anaconda Python. For Mac/Linux/Windows, download the
Anaconda installer from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and follow
the installation instructions. To check your installation, you can try to
start the Python interpreter and load `skimage` and `sklearn` (which come
as part of the Anaconda installation). E.g.,

```bash
python
>> import skimage
```
If this works, your are all set. To start a Jupyter notebook, run

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
### Tools

* Python 2.7 or 3
* Skimage Framework
* OpenCV Framework
* Numpy / Scipy / Pickle Framework
